🚀 NovaPulse – Complete Product Overview
✅ What is NovaPulse?

NovaPulse is a modern SaaS Admin Platform that helps teams manage operations, automate workflows, and gain AI-powered insights from one clean dashboard. It looks and feels like a real startup product — not a simple dashboard project.

🎯 Purpose of NovaPulse

To give teams a central system to manage users, files, analytics, automations, billing, and AI assistance — without using 10 different tools like Airtable, Notion, Zapier, and custom admin dashboards.

🔥 The Problem We Solve

Most businesses today suffer from scattered tools:
❌ Data in different dashboards
❌ Manual repetitive work
❌ No tracking of users or access
❌ No central automation
❌ Slow decision-making
❌ No insights from data

Teams end up reacting instead of operating with clarity.

✅ Our Solution

NovaPulse brings everything together in one clean platform:

Feature	Benefit
User Management (RBAC)	Control access and manage teams securely
Analytics Dashboard	Real-time stats and insights
File & Media Library	Upload, store, and manage files
Automation Builder	Trigger-based workflows
AI Assistant	Generate insights + smart summaries
Billing + Subscription	SaaS monetization (Stripe)
Secure Authentication	JWT + Refresh Token + Roles
Developer Friendly	Modular monorepo + clean API
